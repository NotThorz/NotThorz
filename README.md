👋 Hey, I'm the kind of dev who builds more than I show — most of it lives in private repos.

🛠️ You might’ve seen my name pop up in the Django project — or maybe in projects I’ve built *quietly* for clients on Upwork.

🧩 Got a weird problem? An unsolved puzzle? A strange algorithm idea?

📬 Hit me up.  
If it’s interesting enough, I’ll build it — **for free**.  
Why? Because I like *interesting* more than *profitable*.
